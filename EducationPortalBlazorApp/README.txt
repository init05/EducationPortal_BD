Blazor page uses API from EducationPortal_Solo.
So, if you want to use properly this instance, you need to add new configuration to your IDE.
It must be the compound of two projects:
1. EducationPortal_Solo
2. EducationPortalBlazorApp
If you started two these projects at the same time, you can see list of all users in our DB on FetchData page(left menu bar).
